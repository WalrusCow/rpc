COMPILING
=========

make

The `make` command generates librpc.a and an executable named `binder`

This requires no external dependencies, but should be compiled with gcc version
4.8 or later (already installed on student.linux.uwaterloo.ca).

Note that rpc.h was modified by adding an include guard to the top of the file:
  #pragma once
Without it, including this rpc.h in multiple locations can lead to compilation
errors.

=======
RUNNING
=======

Use ./binder to run the binder program.

=======
LINKING
=======

In order to link the program (for example, using the given source files),
simply copy librpc.a into the directory with the source files and run

g++ -L. SOURCE_FILE... -lrpc
