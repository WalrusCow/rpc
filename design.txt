There are three parts:

Client
======

Uses rpcCall only
Requests server address for a specific function
Send function call directly to server received from binder

int rpcCall(char* name, int* argTypes, void** args) {
  auto serverAddress = getServerAddress(name, argTypes);
  if (!serverAddress) return 1; // No server available or request failed
  // Updates args with results
  auto response = requestFromServer(serverAddress, name, argTypes, args);
  if (!response) return 2; // Server failed
  return 0;
}

Client also calls rpcTerminate() which closes all servers & the binder


Binder
======

When the Binder receives a connection, it adds it to the list of active
connections. This list is for clients, or servers while they initially
register.

  -  A server connection will send a message of type SERVER_REGISTRATION
     to let the Binder know that a particular connection corresponds to a server.

  - A server may later send function registration requests to the Binder.

  - The Binder adds the server connection to the server connections list,
    and removes it from the other connections list.

  - The Binder must listen to the server connections to see if it gets a read
    of size 0. A read of size 0 means the server is terminated.

Takes registration calls from a server for a particular function

registerRpc(char* name, int* types, serverAddress) {
  // Store this name with these types
  // ... or, even better.. turn types into a string and append to name and
  // store as a 1-levle map
  functionMap[name][types] = serverAddress;
}

callRpc(char* name, int* types) {
  return functionMap[name][types]
}

registerServer(serverAddres) {
  // Stores a connection in a db or something. When connection is closed we
  // know that server is gone.
}

// Binder can have connections from clients and also some from the servers

Server
======

First calls rpcInit to open a persistent connection to the binder

Next calls rpcRegister(char* name, int* types, skeleton f)
  this should use almost identical data store as binder

finally calls rpcExecute() which sends server into a listen loop
